            <h2>Taal Volcano, Batangas</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most iconic views in Luzon, Mt. Taal boasts a volcano
              inside a lake inside an island. If you fancy a closer look, the
              hike up to the crater is a mere 45 minutes, and is easy enough for
              beginners. Guides will assist you most of the way, and youâ€™ll see
              the peculiar environment found on an active volcano, including
              volcanic rocks and steam vents. The hike can be dusty and hot, so
              plan for an early morning trip, and then unwind with some bulalo
              before heading back home!
